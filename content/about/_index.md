- I am interested tropical ecology, tree species dominance and distribution, traditional uses of plants by local and indigenous communities in tropical and mediterranean systems. I also study insect population dynamics in the Mediterranean area, focused in predicting pollinator decline.
- I like to understand complex ecological interactions contained in data (R, modelling, statistics, programming, code efficiency) and through visualizations (illustration, design, graphs). 
- I integrate ecological theory, strong technical skills, innovation, and collaboration to foster an open, ethical, dynamic, and creative approach to science.
